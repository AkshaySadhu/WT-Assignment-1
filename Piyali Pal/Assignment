						Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman: Growth Down, But There Won't Be Any Recession</h3>
					<p>
						Acknowledging the economic slowdown, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday defended the state of the economy and dismissed concerns of a recession. "If you are looking at the economy with a discerning view you see that growth may have come down, but its not recession yet or it won't be recession ever," Nirmala Sitharaman said, responding to the debate in Rajya Sabha on the issue of slowing economic growth and Opposition's charge that the economy was in a state of recession. "I will put on record every step being taken," she said. Her remarks come days ahead of the release of official gross domestic product (GDP) numbers for the July-September period.

										Mayank Agarwal is having the time of his life. From his impressive Test debut in Australia last year, to scoring double-centuries in back-to-back series against South Africa and Bangladesh and entering the top 10 in Test rankings, it would seem like the Karnataka opener can do no wrong. But that has not stopped him from forgetting his roots. He took to Twitter to share photos where he is seen with his grandparents, out on a walk, with a nostalgic caption.
